Ethereum protocol - entirely written using smart contracts.
Bitcoin protocol - doesn't have full Touring complete application of smart contracts.

Oracle problem (Source: [link](https://blog.chain.link/what-is-the-blockchain-oracle-problem/))
- Benefit of smart contracts is they are isolated, secure, reliable. BUT this nature leads the out-of-box SC to be unable to access to external data - finanical info, market info via APIs. Therefore, **blockchain oracles** are needed to facilitate communication between blockchains and any off-chain system (data, APIs etc.)
- Oracle
  - enables smart contracts to communicate with external datasources and computation
- hybrid smart contracts
  - SCs with an offchain (external) component
  - [Chainlink](https://chain.link) - most powerful oracle network - allows for smart contract customization

Dapp = Smart Contract = Decentralized App

Ethereum is the most used blockchain SC protocol

## Features of Blockchains 
1. **Decentralized** - no single entity that is controlling assets / freezing funds (GameStop)
2. **Transparency & Flexibility** - every transaction on chain can be seen. 
3. **Speed & Efficiency** - verified by decentralized entity -> faster reaction & operation time
4. **Security & Immutability** - all nodes contain same info. If one goes down, others contain it as backup
5. **Removal of counterparty risk** - BC avoids conflict of interest btw parties
6. **Trust Minimized Agreements** - unlike brand-based agreements of today. Unhappy with a bank, we switch to another bank. BC -> shift to math-based, trustless, repeatable, reliable agreements.

## Ethereum Transaction On a Live  Blockchain
Tools, Terms etc.
- **Testnet** - test networks that act exactly like Ethereum but without real currency. E.g. Rinkeby
- **Block explorer** - views transactions that happen on a blockchain. E.g. Etherscan
- **[Etherscan](https://etherscan.io)** - see transactions on Ethereum BC
- **Gas** - every transaction costs some **gas** / paid to Blockchain miners / we get to pick how much fee we want to send
